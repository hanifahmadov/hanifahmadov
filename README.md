## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior software engineer with recent graduation from a Full Stack Software Development program at GA. With a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to writing clean and efficient code, I am seeking opportunities to work on complex projects in my new career to expand my coding horizons, learn new technologies, and broaden my skill set.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on personal projects every day to keep my skills sharp, which makes me even more excited to explore and go deeper.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and AWS Serverless to expand my skill set and explore new avenues for technology-driven solutions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development and contribute to the developer community.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining my understanding of cloud-native technologies, particularly Kubernetes and Docker, as I aim to incorporate them into our infrastructure.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software design patterns, performance optimization, or best practices in web development.
